            <p>I know you hate me<br>The look between your eyes wants to erase me<br>But isn’t it bout time we made our peace?</p>
            <p>Maybe it’s a little complicated<br>Been there done that<br>I’m not good at waiting<br>Fast lane lifestyle<br>Star in the making<br>I don’t have the strength<br>For another conversation</p>

            <p>Now I'm broken, fell apart<br>And cracked wide open<br>All that’s left for me is hoping<br>If you’re still undecided<br>Spare my mind and-</p>
